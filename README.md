## General Information
- A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market. The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price.
- The company is looking at prospective properties to buy to enter the market. You are required to build a regression model using regularisation in order to predict the actual value of the prospective properties and decide whether to invest in them or not.
- Goal : Find out which variables are significant in predicting the price of a house, and how well those variables describe the price of a house. Also determine the optimal value of lambda for ridge and lasso regression.

## Conclusions
- The top five predictors significant in predicting the price of a house are 'OverallQual_9', 'GrLivArea', 'OverallQual_8', 'Neighborhood_Crawfor' and 'Exterior1st_BrkFace'
- The optimal alpha value for Ridge regression is 20.0
- The optimal alpha value for Lasso regression is 100.0

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, Numpy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
